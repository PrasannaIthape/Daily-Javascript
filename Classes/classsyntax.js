/**
 * What is a class?
So, what exactly is a class? That’s not an entirely new language-level entity, as one might think.

Let’s unveil any magic and see what a class really is. That’ll help in understanding many complex aspects.

In JavaScript, a class is a kind of function.

Here, take a look:
 */
class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  sayHi() {
    alert(this.name);
  }
}

// proof: User is a function
alert(typeof User); // function
